""" Recursion is defined as a tool where a function solving a bigger problem, calls
itself inside it to solve another problem, till the time we reach to a stage
where we have the smallest already solved problem with an extra memory buffer.
Loops are space optimized, recursion is not some algorithms are really easy to
implement via recursion.
