# In python any piece of code which is in one single line and is executable becomes one statement.

print("Hello World") # this is one statement

x=10 # this is another statement

print("hello"); print("world") #this is acceptable but without ; error comes.

# In Python, we can use ; or , terminate a statement but it's not generally recommended.
# ; or , are known as terminators

print("hello") , print("world")

# blocks are set of multiple statements

x = 10 
y = x + 2
print(y**x)

# lines 3,5,7,12,16,17,18 are known as a block of code
